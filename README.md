# re-frame-on-rails

re-frame-on-rails is a Rails engine plugin for connecting a
re-frame based ClojureScript SPA to a Ruby on Rails REST API.

**NOTE:** This is just a placeholder repo for the gem. I am in the process of developing it.


## Features

* Adds all ClojureScript dependencies to Asset Pipeline.
* Ajax/REST helpers to seamlessly transmit data between re-frame and Rails.
* REST handlers on the re-frame side.
* Rake tasks to set up the re-frame project.
* Example code to show how to use this pattern.


## Installation

`gem install re-frame-on-rails`

or with bundler in your Gemfile:

`gem 're-frame-on-rails'`

You also need to have leiningen installed.
